# How the Internet Work ?

- The internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground.
- Computers connected directly to the internet are called "Servers," while the computers you and I use are "clients," because they are not connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider.
- Everythings connected to the internet have an IP adresse.
- Routers shuttle packets of information across the internet, and transmit e-mail, pictures, and web pages.
