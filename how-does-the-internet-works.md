# How the Internet Work ?

- The internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground.
- Computers connected directly to the internet are called "Servers," while the computers you and I use are "clients," because they are not connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider.
- Everythings connected to the internet have an IP adresse. 
- When we transmit data, images, emails, the computer break this informations in small pieces call packets.
When the informations reaches the destination, the packets are reassemble to their original order to make the picture, email, webpages or tweet.

- The internet is ***a Network*** of wires, actually buried in the ground.
- Computers connected directly to the internet are called "Servers," **they are used to stosk all the data, host websites etc ...** While the computers you and I use are "clients," because they are not connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider.
- Everythings connected to the internet have an IP adresse.
- There is routers with teir own IP adress at each connecting point between computers, ISP, and the network.
- Routers shuttle packets of information across the internet, and transmit e-mail, pictures, and web pages.
- Every time someone access a website ther is a back and forth of data betwen the hosting server and the computer.
- On the way up to the servers, these packets are encoded / wraped by each passing routers using their IP as code in superposed layers. The descending data is then unwraped by the corresponding routers on the way down to the computer. This assure the packets arrive in the right computer.
