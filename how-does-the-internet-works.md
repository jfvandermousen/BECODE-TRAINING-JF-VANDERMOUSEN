# How the Internet Work ?

- The internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground.
- Computers connected directly to the internet are called "Servers," while the computers you and I use are "clients," because they are not connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider.
- Everythings connected to the internet have an IP adresse. 
- When we transmit data, images, emails, the computer break this informations in small pieces call packets.
When the informations reaches the destination, the packets are reassemble to their original order to make the picture, email, webpages or tweet.
